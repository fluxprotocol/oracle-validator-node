# Config options

debug | boolean | Logs extra information about each request. Usefull for checking why something is happening | false

dbPath | string | The folder path where the database will be stored | './'

dbName | string | The name of the database | 'flux_db'

stakePerRequest | string | The amount of FLX the node is allowed to spent per stake denominated in 18 decimals | 2500000000000000000 (or 2.5 FLX)

contractIds | string[] | Which contract ids you want to resolve, used for nodes who specificly want to resolve only their own requests. | []

providers | ProviderConfig[] | Configuration for each provider. Required to activate a provider.


## ProviderConfig

Each provider requires their own configuration. This is due the difference between each chain.
All providers have the `id` and options `param`.

id | string | The id of the provider.

options | object | Options of the provider

### NearProvider

`id: "near"`

The NearProvider allows the validator node to stake on the NEAR blockchain. For this provider if you want to use `credentialsStorePath` you are required to have the `near-cli` installed and be logged in:

```Bash
npm install -g near-cli
near login
```

NearProvider has the following config:

credentialsStorePath | string | The path where the `.near-credentials` live. Requires you to use `near login`

privateKey | string | If you don't want to use the `credentialsStorePath` you can also directly insert the private key (prefixed with `ed25519:`)

explorerApi | string | The GraphQL API we will use for fetching requests

accountId | string | The NEAR account id. This account id should be logged in (`near login`)

oracleContractId | string | The contract account id where the oracle is living on

tokenContractId | string | The contract id of the FLX token

net | "testnet"/"mainnet" | Whether we are on testnet or mainnet

maxGas | string | The maximum amount of gas that can be used for this transaction. Best to leave it at the max

storageBase | string | The amount of NEAR to send along each contract interaction for storage. Any unused NEAR gets refuned
