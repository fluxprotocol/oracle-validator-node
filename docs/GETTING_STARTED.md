## Installation

The validator node requires you to have node.js installed. After installing you can run:

```Bash
npm install
```

After this you need to login with your near credentials using:

```Bash
npm install -g near-cli
near login
```

## Configuration

Environment variables are stored in `.env` so that it can be injected into `config.js` from Docker and Node.js.

To create and populate the `.env` file, run the utility script to copy NEAR credientials to `.env` (which auto-detects the location of your `.near-credentials` folder depending on your OS):

```Bash
npm run copyNearCredentials -- --account_id <account_id>
```

The script will prompt you to add or replace lines to your `.env` using your NEAR account information. All information is stored locally and is included in the `.gitignore` so that it won't show up in the Git repository. You can also pass the `--network`, `--path`, and `--help` arguments.

In addition to the account information, other environment variables you can modify are:

* `stakePerRequest` to the amount you want to stake per request. Default is 2.5 FLX (2500000000000000000)

More information about the other options can you find here: LINK_TO_CONFIG_OPTIONS

## Running the node

### Docker

Docker and Docker Compose must be installed before running a containerized validator node. To run a light node (using the Explorer GraphQL and standard RPC):

``` Bash
docker-compose --env-file .env up
```

### Native

Node.js must be installed before running a validator node natively. After installing you can run:

```Bash
npm install
npm start
```

If everything went correctly you should see something like the following:

```
2021-04-28 10:30:37 info: ðŸ¤– Starting oracle node v1.0.0 for NEAR..
2021-04-28 10:30:37 info: ðŸ›  Staking per request 2.50 FLX

```

It can take some time for syncing to complete. Once it's finished it will start looking for jobs and execute them.
